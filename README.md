👋 Hey there, I’m Tanstorm!

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a 14-year-old developer, math enthusiast, and problem-solver who loves turning ideas into reality through code.

From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how technology can make everyday life easier. That passion led me to help develop apps for personal use, including a project that connects my apartment and residency systems—making communication and management smoother for everyone involved. Whether it’s building interfaces or automating tasks, I enjoy exploring ways tech can improve the world around me.

But my interests don’t stop at coding.

📐 I’m also deeply passionate about mathematics, often working on concepts far beyond my grade level. I believe math and programming go hand in hand—both are tools that help us understand and shape the world logically and creatively.

🔭 I’m always learning, always experimenting, and always curious. My goal is to keep growing my skills, contribute to meaningful projects, and eventually earn a place at a top college or university where I can take my passion even further.

Here on my GitHub, you’ll find a mix of personal experiments, school-related tools, and side projects I’m excited to share. I’m still at the beginning of my journey—but every line of code I write brings me one step closer to my goals.

Thanks for stopping by! 👨‍💻✨
